# fontorganizer

A font organizer and visualization platform, designed for usage by comic letterers/typesetters. Currently only supported on Windows.

Current features:
- View the different fonts installed on your computer in their corresponding font face in a compact manner

Future features:
- Tag fonts with custom characteristics, such as Sans Serif, Handwriting, etc.
- Sort fonts by characteristics
- Create visualization (in Photoshop file?) grouping fonts with similar characteristics

## How do I run it?
Open fontorganizer.py in a python code editor or IDE on your Windows machine and run it there. A window should pop up with the application. Because it retrieves font files stored in C:\Windows\Fonts, it will not run in a browser editor or on a non-Windows machine.

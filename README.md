# fontorganizer

A platform for better sorting your fonts. Currently only supported on Windows.

Current features:
- **NEW!**: Automatic tagging of serif and sans-serif fonts!
- View the different fonts installed on your computer in their corresponding font face in a compact manner
- Tag fonts with custom characteristics, such as Sans Serif, Handwriting, etc.

Future features:
- Sort fonts by characteristics/tags
- Create visualization (in Photoshop file?) grouping fonts with similar characteristics

## How do I run it?

Open main.py in a python code editor or IDE on your Windows machine and run it there. A window should pop up with the application. Because it retrieves font files stored in C:\Windows\Fonts, it will not run in a browser editor or on a non-Windows machine.

## Why is this useful? (and what is lettering/typesetting?)

When a comic publisher chooses to publish a comic, they often assign a letterer to choose fonts for covers, titles, word bubbles and sound effects. While it sounds like a deceptively simple task, choosing a font that fits the scenario is often a time consuming task. Typesetting is a synonym for lettering, though the term is more commonly used in the graphic novel translation community, where typesetters have the added task of making the font look similar to the original untranslated text. Graphic designers also face the same challenge when choosing different fonts for headers versus body text, articles versus code editors, website mainpages versus website blog posts, etc.

This application aims to help by reducing the time spent finding similar fonts by allowing you to tag fonts. When you find a font that really vibes with the design of your project, tag it with the project name! Like how well that font goes with that sound effect? Tag it with the sound effect!
